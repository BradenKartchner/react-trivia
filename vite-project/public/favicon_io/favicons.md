I created the base favicon using GIMP, then turned it into favicon files using:
https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/

There are lots of misleading tutorials on the internet for favicon generation.
Just make a 512 x 512 px image, then export it as a png, then use a favicon generator like the above website to convert it.
